=================

# Apache<sup>&reg;</sup> DataSketches&trade; Core Java Library Component
This is the core Java component of the DataSketches library.  It contains all of the sketching algorithms and can be accessed directly from user applications. 

This component is also a dependency of other components of the library that create adaptors for target systems, such as the [Apache Pig adaptor](https://github.com/apache/datasketches-pig), the [Apache Hive adaptor](https://github.com/apache/datasketches-hive), and others.

Note that we have a parallel core component for C++, Python and GO implementations of many of the same sketch algorithms, 
[datasketches-cpp](https://github.com/apache/datasketches-cpp), [datasketches-python](https://github.com/apache/datasketches-python), and 
[datasketches-go](https://github.com/apache/datasketches-go).

Please visit the main [DataSketches website](https://datasketches.apache.org) for more information.

## Build & Runtime Dependencies

### Installation Directory Path
**NOTE:** This component accesses resource files for testing. As a result, the directory elements of the full absolute path of the target installation directory must qualify as Java identifiers. In other words, the directory elements must not have any space characters (or non-Java identifier characters) in any of the path elements. This is required by the Oracle Java Specification in order to ensure location-independent access to resources: [See Oracle Location-Independent Access to Resources](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/lang/resources.html)

### OpenJDK Version 24
An OpenJDK-compatible build of Java 24, provided by one of the Open-Source JVM providers, such as Azul Systems, Red Hat, SAP, Eclipse Temurin, etc, is required.
All of the testing of this release has been performed with an Eclipse Temurin build.

This release uses the new Java Foreign Function & Memory (FFM) features that were made part of the Java Language in in Java 22.

## Compilation and Test using Maven
This DataSketches component is structured as a Maven project and Maven is the recommended tool for compile and test.

#### A Toolchain is required

* You must have a JDK type toolchain defined in location *~/.m2/toolchains.xml* that specifies where to find a locally installed OpenJDK-compatible version 24.
* Your default \$JAVA\_HOME compiler must be OpenJDK compatible, specified in the toolchain, and may be a version greater than 24. Note that if your \$JAVA\_HOME is set to a Java version greater than 24, Maven will automatically use the Java 24 version specified in the toolchain instead. The included pom.xml specifies the necessary JVM flags, so no further action should be required.
* Note that the paths specified in the toolchain must be fully qualified direct paths to the OpenJDK version locations. Using environment variables will not work.

#### To run normal unit tests:

    $ mvn clean test

#### To install jars built from the downloaded source:

    $ mvn clean install -DskipTests=true

This will create the following jars:

* datasketches-java-X.Y.Z.jar The compiled main class files.
* datasketches-java-X.Y.Z-tests.jar The compiled test class files.
* datasketches-java-X.Y.Z-sources.jar The main source files.
* datasketches-java-X.Y.Z-test-sources.jar The test source files
* datasketches-java-X.Y.Z-javadoc.jar  The compressed Javadocs.

## Known Issues

### SpotBugs

* Make sure you configure SpotBugs with the /tools/FindBugsExcludeFilter.xml file. Otherwise, you may get a lot of false positive or low risk issues that we have examined and eliminated with this exclusion file.
