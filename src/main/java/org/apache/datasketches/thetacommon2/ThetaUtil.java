   * was some early Internet discussion that a seed of 0 did not produce as clean avalanche diagrams
   * as non-zero seeds, but this may have been more related to the MurmurHash2 release, which did
   * have some issues. As far as the author can determine, MurmurHash3 does not have these problems.

   * function and seed are identical for both sketches, otherwise the assumed 1:1 relationship
   * between the original source key value and the hashed bit string would be violated. Once
   * you have developed a history of stored sketches you are stuck with it.

   * packages and thus must be declared public. However, this seed value must not be used by library
   * users with the MurmurHash3 function. It should be viewed as existing for exclusive, private
   * use by the library.
