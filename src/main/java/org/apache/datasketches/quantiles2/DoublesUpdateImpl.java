   * This is used to propagate-carry (ripple-carry) an update that will cause the full, sorted
   * base buffer to empty into the levels hierarchy, thus creating a ripple effect up
   * through the higher levels. It is also used during merge operations with the only difference
   * is the base buffer(s) could have valid data and is less than full.
   * This distinction is determined by the <i>doUpdateVersion</i> flag.
   *
   * <p>Prior to this method being called, any extra space for the combined buffer required
   * by either the update or merge operations must already be allocated.</p>
   *
   * <p><b>Update Version:</b> The base buffer is initially full, and after it has been sorted and
   * zipped, will be used as a size2KBuf scratch buffer for the remaining recursive carries.
   * The lowest non-valid level, determined by the bit-pattern, will used internally as a
   * size K scratch buffer and the ultimate target.
   * Thus no additional buffer storage is required outside the combined buffer.</p>
   *
   * <p><b>Merge Version:</b> During merging, each level from the source sketch that must be
   * merged is entered into this method and is assigned to the optional source size K buffer
   * (<i>optSrcKBuf</i>). Because the base buffer may have data, a separate size2K
   * scratch buffer must be provided. The next-lowest. non-valid level, determined by the
   * bit-pattern, will used as a sizeKBuf scratch buffer.</p>
   *
   * <p><b>Downsample Merge Version:</b> This is a variant of the above Merge Version, except at
   * each level the downsampling is performed and the target level is computed for the target merge.
   * In this case the optSrcKBuf is the result of the downsample process and needs to be allocated
   * for that purpose.
   *
   * <p><b>Recursive carry:</b> This starts with a given sorted, size 2K buffer, which is zipped
   * into a size K buffer. If the next level is not valid, the size K buffer is already in position,
   * the bit pattern is updated and returned.</p>
   *
   * <p>If the next level is valid, it is merged with the size K buffer into the size 2K buffer.
   * Continue the recursion until a non-valid level becomes filled by the size K buffer,
   * the bit pattern is updated and returned.</p>
