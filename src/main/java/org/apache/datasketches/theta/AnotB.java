/**
 * Computes a set difference, A-AND-NOT-B, of two theta sketches.
 * This class includes both stateful and stateless operations.
 *
 * <p>The stateful operation is as follows:</p>
 * <pre><code>
 * AnotB anotb = SetOperationBuilder.buildAnotB();
 *
 * anotb.setA(Sketch skA); //The first argument.
 * anotb.notB(Sketch skB); //The second (subtraction) argument.
 * anotb.notB(Sketch skC); // ...any number of additional subtractions...
 * anotb.getResult(false); //Get an interim result.
 * anotb.notB(Sketch skD); //Additional subtractions.
 * anotb.getResult(true);  //Final result and resets the AnotB operator.
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * <p>The stateless operation is as follows:</p>
 * <pre><code>
 * AnotB anotb = SetOperationBuilder.buildAnotB();
 *
 * CompactSketch csk = anotb.aNotB(Sketch skA, Sketch skB);
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * <p>Calling the <i>setA</i> operation a second time essentially clears the internal state and loads
 * the new sketch.</p>
 *
 * <p>The stateless and stateful operations are independent of each other with the exception of
 * sharing the same update hash seed loaded as the default seed or specified by the user as an
 * argument to the builder.</p>

   * <p>An input argument of null will throw an exception.</p>
   *
   * <p>Rationale: In mathematics a "null set" is a set with no members, which we call an empty set.

   * In most cases it is a programming error due to some object that was not properly initialized.
   * With a null as the first argument, we cannot know what the user's intent is.
   * Since it is very likely that a <i>null</i> is a programming error, we throw a an exception.</p>
   *
   * <p>An empty input argument will set the internal state to empty.</p>
   *
   * <p>Rationale: An empty set is a mathematically legal concept. Although it makes any subsequent,
