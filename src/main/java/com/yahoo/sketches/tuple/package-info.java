/**
 * The tuple package contains implementation of sketches based on the idea of
 * theta sketches with the addition of values associated with unique keys.
 * Two sets of tuple sketch classes are available at the moment:
 * generic tuple sketches with user-defined Summary, and a faster specialized
 * implementation with an array of double values.
 * See unit tests for usage examples.
