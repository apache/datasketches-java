<h2>Sketching Core Library</h2> 
<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>The Sketching Core Library provides hashing, sketching and off-heap memory access functionality
from Java. Click on the package links above for more information and code examples.
</p>

<p>This library is divided into four packages that constitute four distinct groups of 
functionality:</p>

<ul>
<li><b><a href="com/yahoo/sketches/hash/package-summary.html">Hash</a></b>
</li>

<li><b><a href="com/yahoo/sketches/theta/package-summary.html">Theta</a></b>
</li>

<li><b><a href="com/yahoo/sketches/memory/package-summary.html">Memory</a></b> 
</li>

<li><b><a href="com/yahoo/sketches/hll/package-summary.html">HLL</a></b> 
</li>
</ul>
Note: If the requirements or promises of any method's contract are not fulfilled (that is, if there is a bug in either the method or its caller), then an unchecked exception will be thrown. The precise type of such an unchecked exception does not form part of any method's contract.
